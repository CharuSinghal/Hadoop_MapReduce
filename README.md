# Hadoop_MapReduce
This program demonstrates Hadoop's Map-Reduce concept in Java using a very simple example. The input is raw data files listing name by age and score, also the word count of data by line. It consists of examples, discussed in "bigdata processing with hadoop" course at algorithmica. It becomes easy to scale data processing over multiple computing nodes.
